07 01 2010	Jan 7, 2010, The last time that we were in Darfur, the Janjaweed attacked us. It was midnight and we were in the church. They attacked many Churches in the area; many were killed and beaten. Afterward, they threw those of us who survived into prison. The prison belonged to the government, which was working together with the Janjaweed. In prison, they tied our arms and legs together, covered our eyes, and beat and tortured us with electric shocks. In 2005, I managed to escape from the prison and left Sudan. The prison officers were searching for anyone who escaped the prison so I was forced to flee Sudan. I arrived in Cairo, Egypt and submitted an application for asylum through the UN. In the meantime, I worked as a cleaner; however, I was treated as a slave. They screamed at me and humiliated me. If I spoke a word, I would have been beaten. No one in Egypt would have cared if they saw Sudanese men and women dead in the street. In late 2005, I was placed in prison in Egypt but I knew that I had to leave. The journey to Israel would cost $400. I did not buy anything and I saved every cent I earned. The moment I had enough money, I left for Israel. On the way to Israel, I injured my foot. Despite this, I managed to cross the border and arrive in Israel. In Israel many people have helped me. In my entire life, no one has helped me and opened doors for me as they have here. Testimony of Sussana, a refugee from South Sudan. http://www.assaf.org.il/en/refugees/testimonies

So I said, ‘you must come back home and we'll see what to do'. When my wife was sick, I didn't know what I was doing, lots of doctors, x-rays, ultrasounds. I realized that if I didn't go out of the country our children would not go to school because of this poverty. That is why I decided to sell my animals, land, everything, because I spent more than $5000 to come here." (Z7, male, Philippines) http://lib.ruppin.ac.il/multimedia_library/pdf/38849.pdf p.51

According to the survey, which canvassed 500 foreign workers, Inter-Man charged workers upwards of $10,000 in exchange for the chance to come and work in Israel with a permit.

01 10 2010	Oct 1, 2010, If I stayed in Darfur, I would have been killed. So, I chose to come to Israel. While many others escaped to Egypt, it is still not an ideal place to live as there are many hardships there. I left Darfur because of the conflicts that were taking place. We were farmers and my village was attacked three times by the Janjaweed in 2000 and 2001. It was during the second attack that I lost my father. Each time the village was attacked, people tried to flee, but the Arabs shot them and killed many of my friends and family. I myself was attacked, too, however, I prefer not to talk about that. After the third attack, I fled to a refugee camp, where the weather was very hot and no one paid us any attention. Many people died there from the heat and diseases.We fled to Egypt. Life was very hard there and we were prisoners in our own homes. The Arabs in Egypt hate Black people. When I left the house, stones were thrown at me and I was called a "blackee". We wanted to escape Egypt so my husband asked for money from friends in Canada and Australia. It was only then that we were able to make it to Israel. Do not return us to Egypt or Sudan - I am willing to go anyplace else. Testimony of Fatma, a refugee from Darfur. http://www.assaf.org.il/en/refugees/testimonies

01 02 2011	Feb 1, 2011, We chose to come to Israel because we thought this would be a secure place. In Egypt, we could not live peacefully and securely. Problems in Darfur began in the year 2000. The Janjaweeds arrived with weapons and tanks. They shot, destroyed, and killed. By 2001, my entire family had been killed. The Janjaweed murdered both my father and mother when they tried to escape from our village. The only other member of my family to survive was my older sister Aziza. Together, with many others refugees, we fled to the mountains, where we stayed for a month. Then we fled to Egypt. The treatment we received from the Egyptians was horrible. When Sudanese people walk in the street, they are beaten and robbed. Even the Egyptian Police kill many Sudanese. It was then that we decided to flee from Egypt to Israel, being our only safe haven. Ever since we left Khartoum I have had no contact with my sister, the only other member of my family still alive.

01 03 2012	Mar 1, 2012, ...migrants from Asia [have increased] their share to 74 percent of all arrivals in 2010. This is explained by the changing composition of work permits, which has reduced the number of construction workers (from East Europe, mainly from Romania and Turkey) and increased the number of those employed in agriculture (from Thailand) and domestic caregiving (mainly from the Philippines but lately also from India, Nepal, and Sri-Lanka).  http://lib.ruppin.ac.il/multimedia_library/pdf/38849.pdf p.15
08 03 2012	Mar 8, 2012, The increasing feminization of labor migration to Israel is a consequence of the increasing share of work permits in the caregiving sector and the fact that the majority of work permits are granted to women. Most of the workers in the care-giving sector have arrived to Israel from the Philippines, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Filipinos account for 64 percent of all non-Israeli care-givers, Nepalese for about 17 percent, and Sri Lankans for about 9 percent (Central Bureau of Statistics of Israel, [CBS], 2011). The rest arrive from various countries including the former Soviet Union and India. http://lib.ruppin.ac.il/multimedia_library/pdf/38849.pdf p.1508 03 2012	Mar 8, 2012, The increasing feminization of labor migration to Israel is a consequence of the increasing share of work permits in the caregiving sector and the fact that the majority of work permits are granted to women.

The data show that, as expected, the caregiving sector is female-dominated: all the Nepalese, 79 percent of the Sri Lankan and 75 percent of the Filipino migrants in our sample are women. The majority of migrants in this sector are concentrated in the central labor-force ages, between 25 and 44, and the average age ranges from 35.5 for Nepalese and 37.6 for Filipinos to 40 for Sri Lankans. Data on marital status reveal that the majority of migrants in the caregiving sector are married (57.6 percent), a third are single, and about ten percent are divorced or widowed. Some Sri Lankan and Filipino migrants—11.8 and 22.5 percent, respectively—are currently residing with their spouses in Israel. http://lib.ruppin.ac.il/multimedia_library/pdf/38849.pdf p.33
26 03 2012	Mar 26, 2012, The two other sectors, agriculture and construction, are male-dominated. Workers from Thailand in the agriculture sector tend to be young (32 years on average) and are divided equally between single and married individuals (about 45 percent each), whereas Chinese workers in construction are 40 years old on average and the majority (90 percent) are married. In both groups the migrants' spouses and children reside in the country of origin. http://lib.ruppin.ac.il/multimedia_library/pdf/38849.pdf p.35

23 05 2012	May 23, 2012, On May 23, 2012 residents of south Tel Aviv organized a rally to protest the high concentration of African migrants in Tel Aviv and the government's lack of response to the situation. Several politicians addressed the crowd: MK Miri Regev compared the infiltrators to a "cancer" in Israel's body...MK's Danny Danon and Michael Ben Ari also spoke out against African migrants and called upon the government to act immediately by detaining and deporting all "infiltrators." Violence was quick to break out, as some members of the crowd smashed the windows of shops run by African migrants, pillaging and destroying goods. Several migrants were also physically attacked by protesters. http://www.hias.org/ru/post/26/xenophobic-violence-asylum-seekers-israel
31 05 2012	May 31, 2012, In April – May 2012 there was an increase in reports of crimes allegedly committed by African migrants, including robbery and rape. Police officials were quoted stating that migrants are involved in 40% of the crimes in the Tel Aviv District. In a Knesset discussion on crime in south Tel Aviv, senior police officials attributed the increased crime among migrants to the fact they are prohibited from working, calling some of these acts "crimes of survival." Police Chief Yohanan Danino has encouraged enabling asylum seekers to work as a means of reducing the crime rate. http://www.hias.org/ru/post/26/xenophobic-violence-asylum-seekers-israel

The bill was criticized by the Deputy Attorney General, who stated that there is "a mish-mash" of laws which are wholly unrelated. The lack of cohesive legislation that deals with the employment of asylum seekers and with migration in general contributes to the confusion and instability surrounding this issue and leaves much room for a negative public sentiment to thrive. http://www.hias.org/ru/post/26/xenophobic-violence-asylum-seekers-israel
13 06 2012	Jun 13, 2012, Approximately 85% of all "infiltrators" are from Eritrea and Sudan (about 34,000 Eritreans and 15,700 Sudanese, including South Sudanese). The remaining 15% are mostly from other African countries. http://www.hias.org/ru/post/26/xenophobic-violence-asylum-seekers-israel
19 07 2012	Jul 19, 2012, Israel has initiated the first stage of a controversial ‚Äúemergency plan‚Äù aimed at interning and deporting an estimated 60,000 African immigrants. Officials believe the presence of the Africans poses a threat to the ‚ÄúJewish character‚Äù of the state. Israeli authorities are ready to grant 1,000 euros to any African who agrees to freely leave within five days.

I was with one child and pregnant with seven months and he left me when I was pregnant. And when I give birth, the government asked me where my husband is. They told me either bring him or pay 50,000 Nakfa.q I told them I can't pay. I don't have. So either the solution: either I stayed there because they are going to trouble me. So, the solution, I decided to escape.

08 09 2012	Sept 8, 2012, I ran away from Eritrea seven months ago to avoid the army service. I intended to find refuge in Sudan, but when I arrived in Sudan, crossing the border by foot, with several other Eritreans, some Bedouins arrived with a vehicle and kidnapped us. Some of us succeeded in running away but they managed to kidnap me along with others. They locked us up in a small house in Kassala, beating us daily with a stick. They threatened me "if you will not pay us $35,000, you will be our woman." I gave them phone numbers of my family members but they told the kidnappers that they don't have a possibility to raise such amount of money. I was locked there in a dark room for four months. I discovered that I got pregnant. We received very little food and I was beaten constantly. I had a miscarriage. It took my family long months to raise the money and I was taken with others to Sinai. There they requested $3,400 more. It took three more months for my family to raise the additional sum. We were released near the border of Israel with a group of about 30 Eritreans. The Egyptian soldiers shot at us on the way. Some of us got frightened and returned back to the Egyptian side. We arrived to the giant new fence on the Israeli border and we were not able to cross it. We waited there in the sun for long days with no food and water. There were Israeli soldiers on the other side who kept on telling us to go back.
15 09 2012	Sept 15, 2012, There were several children with us who could not suffer it any longer and attempted to go back. The Egyptian soldiers shouted to the children "you cannot come back unless you bring us the women in your group." We refused to go back, knowing why they want us back. At the end, the Israeli soldiers came to our side, forced many of us to go to the Egyptian soldiers and let the women in. It was easy for them to push the people back since they were starved for many days and too weak to resist. In prison, where we are now, they treat us very well. A woman from the UNHCR came and told us that we can apply for asylum. I had a meeting with a judge and a translator to Tigrinya, Frowini. She asked me if I agree to go back to Eritrea and told me "You will be in this prison for three years. Didn't you hear about it?" I told her that if I go back I will be imprisoned for running away from the army service but she did not answer. The judge said that until there will be a solution, I will stay in prison.

01 10 2012	Oct 1, 2012, In recent years, there has been a sharp increase in the arrival of asylum seekers to Israel. By the end of June 2012, about 57,193 asylum seekers resided in Israel, originating mainly from Sudan (15,210 people - 25.91%) and Eritrea (35,895 people - 63%). The asylum seekers enter Israel via the Sinai desert by crossing the Egypt-Israel border. Since June 2012 the numbers of new asylum seekers entering Israel significantly dropped, as detailed: In June – 938 entered, in July – 268, in August – 199, in September – 138. http://www.hotline.org.il/english/pdf/TorturedInSinaiJailedInsraelENG.pdf October, 2012
06 10 2012	Oct 6, 2012, All asylum seekers who have entered Israel since June 2012 have been imprisoned in harsh conditions with little chance of being released. This policy, which violates the rights accorded to asylum seekers under the Refugee Convention, also results in feelings of hopelessness and helplessness among detained asylum seekers. The effects of prolonged internment are especially disastrous for torture survivors. http://www.hotline.org.il/english/pdf/TorturedInSinaiJailedInsraelENG.pdf October, 2012
08 10 2012	Oct 8, 2012, Israel has recognized only 157 asylum seekers as refugees according to the Refugee Convention since signing it in 1951. Israel refused to check asylum requests of Sudanese and Eritreans despite the fact that some of them live in Israel for about two decades. The average recognition rate of Eritrean asylum seekers around the world is 84.5% and the average recognition rate of Sudanese is 74.4%.8 That means that there is a high probability that if the requests are examined properly and fairly, a similar average rate would be found in Israel as well. http://www.hotline.org.il/english/pdf/TorturedInSinaiJailedInsraelENG.pdf October, 2012
12 10 2012	Oct 12, 2012, ... Currently, based on the NGOs statistics, about 5,000 to 7,000 torture survivors reside in Israel without any social rights or assistance. In addition, a study conducted by EEPA and Tilburg University based on testimonies of tortured Eritrean asylum seekers while in captivity and after, it estimated that 4,000 asylum seekers did not survive the torture camps and journey and lost their lives in the desert in the past five years. http://www.hotline.org.il/english/pdf/TorturedInSinaiJailedInsraelENG.pdf October, 2012
18 10 2012	Oct 18, 2012, The lack of proper identification procedures and treatment of torture survivors by Israeli authorities can be observed when comparing the number of survivors identified and treated by Israeli authorities to the number of those identified and treated by PHR-IL: During 2011, 54 women complained to the Israeli authorities and revealed the fact that they were sexually assaulted, 23 of them received gynecological treatment. That same year, 1,585 women (the majority of whom are African) were sent by PHR-IL to gynecological treatment and 21 of them underwent abortions. http://www.hotline.org.il/english/pdf/TorturedInSinaiJailedInsraelENG.pdf October, 2012
24 10 2012	Oct 24, 2012, Dozens of Gaza rockets strike southern Israel overnight. Three civilians, all foreign workers, were injured during the attacks and were evacuated by helicopter to a hospital in Beer Sheva. The Jerusalem Post reported that two of the injured were in a critical condition. http://www.bicom.org.uk/news-article/9660/
30 10 2012	Oct 30, 2012, Since 2009, smugglers in the Sinai have imprisoned thousands of asylum seekers en route to Israel in harsh conditions while demanding increasing sums of money for their release. To motivate the relatives of the captives to pay, the asylum seekers are tortured, raped, humiliated and starved by the smugglers. http://www.hotline.org.il/english/pdf/TorturedInSinaiJailedInsraelENG.pdf October, 2012
06 11 2012	Sept 6, 2012, According to a report published by Human Rights Watch, the Hotline for Migrant Workers and PHRIL, between June and October 2012 there were at least eight groups of asylum seekers that were pushed back to Egypt by the IDF. http://www.hotline.org.il/english/pdf/TorturedInSinaiJailedInsraelENG.pdf October, 2012
20 12 2012	Dec 20, 2012, On December 20, 2011, an agreement was signed between the Israeli and Bulgarian Governments according to which Bulgarian workers shall be recruited to work in the construction sector in a fair and transparent manner, with the objective of avoiding the payment of illegal recruitment fees. http://lib.ruppin.ac.il/multimedia_library/pdf/38849.pdf p.23
31 12 2012	Dec 31, 2012, Number of migrants crossing border drops to zero as vast steel fence from Eilat to Gaza border nears completion. "There is no doubt the fence is working as a deterrent," said Sigal Rosen, of the Hotline for Migrant Workers. But, she added, Israel's policy of preventing refugees crossing the fence, which is constructed on Israeli territory, was illegal under international law. "If a person is asking for asylum, a country has a duty to check their request." http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/31/israeli-fence-cuts-migration-egypt
Jan 1 2013	Jan 1, 2013, Israel granted permits to 80,000 migrants in 2012.
